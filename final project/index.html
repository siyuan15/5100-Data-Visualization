      <h2>A Look at Ride Sharing Data in New York City</h2>
      <p>
        Data Visualization - Project 1
      </p>

      <p class = "intro">
        The following project, completed by Derrick Ho (dhh73), Lini Tan (lt398), and Siyuan Yin (sy652), focuses on data for ride sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft. Specifically, our intention for this project was to look at when exactly pickups were most frequently occuring along with whether there was a correlation between wealth, population, landsize, and the number of pickups. For example, while Queens is one of the larger boroughs of New York, does that have any correlation to the number of pickups. Or does the wealth level in Manhattan make a difference in this also. The below visualizations contain data from a number of different datasets and will walk you through our process of thinking.

      <h3>Average pickups by Ride Sharing Company</h3>
      <p>
        In starting our project, we wanted to first look at how the market is divided between the two main companies, Uber and Lyft. Specifically, we looked at the average pickups per day from July to September, looking at the data by each week.<br><br>
        From July to Septembr 2014, The average number of daily pickups of Uber in New York City was 43,205, approximately 5.5 times more than Lyft Graphs below shows how the amount of Uber pickuo changes corresponding to pickup location, demographic informations, and time. In realizing how many total ride shares occur on average, we were able to put into context the rest of our data relative to land area, population, and wealth of the New York City metro area.

      <h3>Demographic information VS. Number of Pickup</h3>
      <p class = "narrative">
        Our next step was to look at whether there was a correlation between either land area, wealth, or population for all these pickups. <br><br>
        Below are three different graphs that compare each category to the number of ride share pickups in each New York borough. There was no direct correlation with any of the categories except population though. We found it interesting that while Manhattan had the smallest land area, they had the highest wealth leverl, population, and overall total number of pickups. <br><br>
        We then decided to move forward and look specifically at Manhattan and where exactly these pickups are happening.

      <h3>Manhattan Pickup Locations Heatmap</h3>
      <p>
        The graph below is a heatmap of total pickups in the Manhattan borough. We noticed that compared to the rest of the boroughs, there was no other area that contained this many pickups in such a small area. For reference, each pickup is represented by a dot with 10% opacity. The more pickups there are in a location, the more defined the area is. Compared to Manhattan, the few dots shown on the right side of the map (Queens and Brooklyn) were what the rest of the New York Metro area looked like. Only Manhattan contained such a defined shade of white.<br><br>

        We have circled the area below for reference. Midtown is known to be where most of the 'action' in New York takes place and where most people go for work. Additionally, we honed in on the most defined area in Manahattan and identified it to be Midtown.

      <h3>Time of Day VS. Number of Pickups</h3>
      <p>
      Finally, after identifying Midtown as the most populous area for ride sharing pickups, we wanted to look at the timing of these pickups. The below graph is a representation of this data with shade and size of dot representing the amount of pickups happening at that time. The below makes sense as there is a spike of ubers getting to work on the weekdays along with people coming home from work around 6pm. It is also of note that the trend of pickups and timing of pickups are later as the week progresses which can be attributed to nightlife going on since more people are inclined to go out later in the week and on weekends.
